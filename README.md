# GradCam_Based_Explainable_AI
In this project, a CNN model has been trained to classify the type of scenery in an image. A technique called GradCam is used to locate the specific areas in the image which play a key role in 
leading the model to make the classification decision. The dataset for this project can be found here :

Following are the key learning objectives of this project:

## 1. Deep Learning Foundations:

- Gain a solid understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of Deep Neural Networks, including Residual Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
## 2. Image Processing and Data Preparation:

-Master the use of Python libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, OpenCV) to effectively import, preprocess, and visualize image data for deep learning tasks.
- Implement data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness and generalization.
## 3. CNN Model Development:

- Design and build a custom Convolutional Neural Network architecture incorporating Residual blocks using Keras with TensorFlow 2.0 as the backend.
- Train and evaluate the developed CNN model using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
## 4. Model Interpretability:

- Explore and implement Grad-CAM to visualize the activation maps of the trained CNN, providing valuable insights into its decision-making process.
- Develop an understanding of Explainable AI (XAI) concepts and their importance in the context of deep learning.
